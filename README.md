__*Android Implementation of 'Diced' ToDo Assistant*__

## Status

**2023-06-07** Nothing here yet.


Back in 2015 I came up with a procedure for *Getting Things Done*, well, at least a procedure for choosing which task to do next.

I [blogged](https://hyperdata.it/blog/2015/05/11/getting-things-diced/) about it then and started an implementation a little while later. Then got distracted. 

Now in 2023 I'm returning to it.

Since my last abortive attempt, the Android coding landscape has changed somewhat and I've not kept up. So rather than building on my previous attempt I decided to start again from scratch.
